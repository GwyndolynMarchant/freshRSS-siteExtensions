# Gwyn's FreshRSS e621 Site Extension

## Main features
- Uses API calls to recover full post information
- Tags are called through API and properly populated
- Full size images and videos are embedded

## Limitations
Using public API calls so pausing one (1) second before retrieving data, for politeness. Initial feed ingestion takes a while, but the rest should be seamless behind the scenes after that.
