# Gwyn's FreshRSS Site Extensions

If like me you're a total freak for RSS feeds, you probably have realized that a bunch of sites actually support RSS! Or Atom. But what you may have unfortunately discovered is that a lot of them are Bad ðŸ˜”. Because of this, I've written a bunch of site-specific extensions which reformat feed elements to be better, often performing API calls or scrubbing HTML content for better results!

# Currently supported sites
- [Danbooru](xExtension-Danbooru/README.md): Using the [API](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:api).
- [DeviantArt](xExtension-Deviantart/README.md): Redirected through the [secret backend](https://github.com/aai210/DeviantArt-RSS).
