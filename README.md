# Gwyn's FreshRSS Site Extensions

If like me you're a total freak for RSS feeds, you probably have realized that a bunch of sites actually support RSS! Or Atom. But what you may have unfortunately discovered is that a lot of them are Bad ðŸ˜”. Because of this, I've written a bunch of site-specific extensions which reformat feed elements to be better, often performing API calls or scrubbing HTML content for better results!
